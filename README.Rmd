The goal of `tpSVG` is to detect and visualize spatial variation in the gene expression for spatially resolved transcriptomics data analysis. Specifically, `tpSVG` introduces a family of count-based models, with generalizable parametric assumptions such as Poisson distribution or negative binomial distribution. In addition, comparing to currently available count-based model for spatially resolved data analysis, the `tpSVG` models improves computational time, and hence greatly improves the applicability of count-based models in SRT data analysis. 



## Installation

### GitHub
You can install the development version of tpSVG from [GitHub](https://github.com/boyiguo1/tpSVG) with:

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("boyiguo1/tpSVG")
```

### Bioconductor (pending)
The package is currently submitted to Bioconductor for [review](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/3264). Once the package
is accepted by Bioconductor, you can install the latest release
version of `tpSVG` from Bioconductor via the following code. Additional details
are shown on the Bioconductor page.
```{r eval = FALSE}
# NOTE: The package is under-review with bioconductor.
#       The following code section will work once the package is accepted.

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("tpSVG")
```

The latest development version can also be installed from the `devel` version
of Bioconductor or from GitHub following

```{r eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install(version='devel')
```

## Frequently asked questions

__Implementation Questions__

* What are the data structures that `tpSVG` current supports?

  _As of `tpSVG v0.99.1`, the data structure `tpSVG` supports includes [`SpatialExperiments`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialFeatureExperiment.html) (and packages extending `SpatialExperiments`, e.g.  [`SpatialFeatureExperiments`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialFeatureExperiment.html)) and `data.frame`. Please find example via [supported_data_structure](https://boyi-guo.com/escheR/articles/supported_data_structure.html). Due to limited resources, we regret that we won't provides direct accessibility to other pipelines, e.g. `suerat`._

* What types of spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data that `tpSVG` supports?

  _Both sequenced-based SRT and image-based SRT are supported by `tpSVG`.
For more details, please refer to the vignette [supported_data_structure]](https://boyi-guo.com/tpSVG/articles/supported_data_structure.html#image-based-srt-in-spatialexperiment-e-g--spatialfeatureexperiment)._


* Can I use other scale factor as offset in the count-model?

  _Yes, just remember to take log for the offset term. In the vignettes, the offset of the model is default to library size, i.e. the total number of molecular in a spot/cell, but the count models should be compatible to other definition of scale factor in theory._


__Theoretical Questions__

* What is the difference between modeling log transformed data and count data?

  _Count data is the natural form of gene expression data when it is collected
and quantified. While log-transformation providess shortcuts to model
(normalized) count data using well-studied Gaussian distribution, it distorts
the lowly expressed gene and causes analytic biases._
